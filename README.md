## Database

Driver is the std, lib/pq, with the addition of sqlx


## Testing

It uses JSONNET for fixtures, go-cmp for diffs.
From std lib, it'll use httpstub and httptest for stubbing http reqs and go-sqlmock for mocking sql responses

Fixtures will be under testdata/<entity>.jsonnet, being entity the name of the model created on ent/*.go
